# GeoAI-For-Climate-Change-Mitigation-IndabaX2024-Workshop

This is a workshop I hosted at the 2024 Nigerian IndabaX conference. 

# AIM

This session will explore the application of geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) to address climate-related challenges in Nigeria through the analysis of satellite imagery. Participants will learn how to leverage advanced geospatial analytical techniques to monitor and develop climate change solutions using geospatial data.
